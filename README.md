This smart and elegantly designed website has awesome features like Home , Shop , Blog , About , Contact , AddToCart , hover effects, smooth Scrolling navigation , and much more. This website is a 100% responsive cross-browser template, compatible on all devices, and displayed on all screen sizes. This project is created both for sellers and customers as it has an attractive design to draw customers' attention and helps the seller to showcase their best products.
